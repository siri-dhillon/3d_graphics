Hello Sanjay, hi everyone

I have about 2 years of Sofatware developmnet internship experience 
but no work related experience in Cloud. 

My experience with AWS is through K21 Academy and their labs 

Been in the job hunting phase for last couple of months so currently 
working out of the tech industry full time and freelancing 
as a web developer and Marketing content creator.
